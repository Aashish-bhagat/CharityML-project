# CharityML-project
Machine learning technique
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization that wants to expand their potential donor base by sending letters to residents of the region where it is located, but only to the ones who would most likely donate. After nearly 32000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50000 annually. So our goal is to build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail.
